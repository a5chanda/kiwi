## About Kiwi 

Kiwi is a customer relationship and asset management platform targeted for small businesses and regular consumers built with IBM's Hyperledger Fabric. The platform aims to help small businesses establish and transition themselves on a decentralized, blockchain network and conduct their daily transactions within the network. Moreover, Kiwi enables small-medium sized businesses to easily conduct business to business and business to consumer transactions. For example, they can manage employee payroll, recruit new employees, list current services and products available for purchase, and contact other businsess to inquire about their services. 

Additionally, the customer facing side enables consumers to conduct peer to peer transactions in the efforts to shift to a cashless economy. Regular customers have the ability to apply to job postings, purchase services offerred by current businesses, and the ability to start their own business as well.
